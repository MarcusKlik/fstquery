Contributions to `fstquery` are welcome from anyone and are best sent as pull requests on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/marcusklik/fstquery/). This page provides some instructions to potential contributors about how to add to the package.

1. Contributions can be submitted as [a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on GitHub by forking or cloning the [fstquery repository](https://github.com/marcusklik/fstquery/), making changes and submitting the pull request.
 
2. Pull requests should involve only one commit per substantive change. This means if you change multiple files (e.g., code and documentation), these changes should be committed together. If you don't know how to do this (e.g., you are making changes in the GitHub web interface) just submit anyway and the maintainer will clean things up.

4. All contributions must be submitted consistent with the package license ([AGPL-3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)).
 
5. Contributions in the code (not documentation) that consist of more than 1000 characters (excluding spaces and
comments) need to be noted in the `Authors@R` field in the [`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/marcusklik/fstquery/blob/master/DESCRIPTION) file. Just follow the format of the existing entries to add your name (and, optionally, email address).
 
6. This package uses `royxgen` code and documentation markup, so changes should be made to `roxygen` comments in the source code `.R` files. If changes are made, `roxygen` needs to be run. The easiest way to do this is a command line call to: `Rscript -e devtools::document()`. Please resolve any `roxygen` errors before submitting a pull request.
 
7. Please run `R CMD BUILD fstquery` and `R CMD CHECK fstquery_VERSION.tar.gz` before submitting the pull request to check for any errors.
 
8. Changes requiring a new package dependency should be discussed on the GitHub issues page before submitting a pull request.
 
Any questions you have can be opened as GitHub issues or directed to markklik (at) gmail.com.
